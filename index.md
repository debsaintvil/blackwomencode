Black Women Code will host supportive goal-setting meetings on Mondays at 7PM. The goal of each meeting is to create a welcoming and productive space for a variety of ambitions. We will encourage participants to 
1. Set a goal for progress in their career 
2. Offer accountability, suggestions, and help make connections so others can reach their goal.

Additionally, our aim will be to validate each other's workplace and education issues to create a strong community.
